        <h2>Hey there,</h2>
        <p>My name is Vadim. I am an aspiring programmer who is interested in all kinds of programming, starting from simple web-development, 
          and all the way to computer vision and machine learning. I am currently in High - School, but later in life I hope to become a full 
          stack developer. </p>
          <p>As of now I am most confident when working with Javascript, Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and AutoHotKey, but also 
              have experience working with different electronics like Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3. I am confident that I can learn anything I put my mind to.
              I am also interested in physics, history, and economics, although all to a lesser extent than computer science. Outside of academics, I am very 
              interested in different video games such as Tetris, Tekken, and Legend of Zelda.</p>
